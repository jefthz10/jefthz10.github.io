                <h4>Davao - Life is here.</h4>
                <p>
                    My first visit to Davao was in October 2017 when I took the exam at the BPO company. My experienced
                    in Davao during my visit, I was impressed with the friendly atmosphere of the people wherever you go
                    in the city. It’s also amazing that the street is very clean, the park is well maintained and felt
                    secure anywhere you go even on late evening. I also love the foods and the discounted merchandise at
                    the night market located in Roxas Street. Davao has a plenty of attractions and sights to enjoy
                    and one them is the Eden Nature Park and Resort. You will surely enjoy the beautiful sceneries and
                    recreational activities on the different tourist attractions in Davao.

                <h4>Baguio - Summer Capital of the Philippines</h4>
                <p>
                    During my trip to Baguio City, I've experienced the weather like other countries. I had a wonderful
                    and amazing experienced exploring all the best tourists spots in the city. My family and I visited
                    15 destinations but among those destinations, The Old Diplomat Hotel was my favorite. Also had a
                    chance to set foot at the Philippine Military Academy. And aside from beautiful destinations there,
                    I also enjoyed the taste of fresh vegetable and fruits in this wonderful place. I really love the
                    foods especially the Chopsuey of The Good Taste Restaurant. My travel experience in Baguio was
                    probably one of the best and memorable travels of my life.
